<b>User Defined Tracing - How it works</b>

<p>
USDT is a mechanism for user land applications to embed their
own probes into executables. For example, a Perl or Python 
interpreter might use it to gain access to stack traces of applications
which are already started.

<p>
The goal of the DTrace team was near zero overhead when not invoked.
This works well - even commercial applications can embed
probes and not worry about performance or run time dependencies.

<p>
The steps involved in a USDT probe are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Add probe calls, via DTRACE_PROBE macros to the source code
  of the application.</li>
  <li>Compile code to object file (*.o)</li>
  <li>Use dtrace command line tool to convert the object file. This involves
  stubbing out the assembler function calls, and creating a table
  in the ELF file enumerating the probes.
  </li>
  <li>Create (link) the application binary, with a special object file
  (drti.o). drti.o runs before main() and takes the table
  of probes, and lets the kernel know (via an ioctl() to the dtrace
  driver) of the probes.</li>
  <li>Run the application: drti.o takes control and issues the ioctl()
  of the probes. Whilst the application is running, you can use "dtrace -l"
  to see the probes. Probes are a function of the pid provider, so you
  will see a new suite of probes for each process running with USDT, and
  as many probes as there are DTRACE_PROBE calls in the source code.</li>
  <li>Whilst the application is running, you can use dtrace to monitor
  these probes at any granularity you like (eg all probes from the process,
  or specific probes from all such processes).</li>
  <li>When a dtrace monitors the probe, the site where the call instruction
  is placed is modified and an INT3 (breakpoint instruction) is placed
  at the site of what was the original CALL instruction. When the breakpoint
  is hit, the dtrace driver takes control and actions the probe.
  This is very similar to how a kernel FBT probe works, except the
  breakpoint happened in user space. At the point of breakpoint execution,
  any D script associated with the probe is invoked. The target application
  is frozen until the D script completes, allowing it to take a
  static snapshot of any details it likes. Typically, this might include
  taking a user stack dump (ustack()).
  </li>
  <li>Terminating a dtrace which is probing the application will
  remove the breakpoints and restore the NOP instructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Annotating a program with custom probes</h2>
<p>
DTrace provides a bunch of DTRACE_PROBEn() macros which allow
you to place probes in source code. The macros allow for zero to 4 arguments
to be passed. DTrace also allows you to provide application specific
macros. The following example shows using the raw macros.

<pre>
# include &lt;stdio.h>
# include &lt;sys/sdt.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	while (1) {
		printf("here on line %d\n", __LINE__);
		DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__line, 0x1234);
		printf("here on line %d\n", __LINE__);
		DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__word, 0x87654321);
		printf("here on line %d\n", __LINE__);
		DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__word, 0xdeadbeef);
		printf("here on line %d\n", __LINE__);
		sleep(1);
		}
}
</pre>


<p>
The DTRACE_PROBEx macros translate into a function call.
To gain near-zero overhead, during linking, the function call
is replaced by a series of NOP instructions. Heres an example disassembly
of the above

<pre>
#define	DTRACE_PROBE1(provider, name, arg1) {				\
	extern void __dtrace_##provider##___##name(unsigned long);	\
	__dtrace_##provider##___##name((unsigned long)arg1);		\
}
</pre>

The macro looks a little ugly, but its basically putting in a C
function call to a parameterised function name, e.g.
__dtrace__simple__saw__word, in the example above. Theres a number
of macros depending on the number of arguments (1..5).
In the example above, its as if we did something like:

<pre>
	__dtrace__simple__saw__word(0x12345678);
</pre>

The function __dtrace__simple__saw__word never exists - its simply a place
holder.

<p>
When an application is built, dtrace is run on the
object files to rewrite the objects, stubbing out the calls
for probes, and creating a table in the executable of the
places where the stubs are located. (The code
for this is located in libdtrace/dt_link.c).

<p>
When the application is started up, a piece of code is
executed (before main() is called). [Code located in
libdtrace/drti.c]. This code looks at the current system,
to see if dtrace is loaded into the kernel and communicates
with the /dev/dtrace/helper driver to inform it that new
probes are available in this process.

<p>
Voila! We are done. Or nearly.

<p>
At this point, whilst the application is running, 'dtrace -l'
should reveal your new probes.

<b>The Kernel</b>

When a user elects to monitor the probe, the patched (NOP-ed) code
will be change into a call back into the kernel to notify the
function/probe is being invoked.

Cancellation of the probe will undo the patched code and we are done.

You can see these user level code segment modifications in the
example usdt/c/simple.c code. It computes a checksum of the main()
function and periodically dumps the checksum. If you attach to the
probes with dtrace, the checksum will change, and as you Ctrl-C dtrace,
the checksum will be restored.

<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>
DTrace relies on the DTRACE_PROBE macros to create the assembler
sequence to call a dummy function. When a probe is activated, the 
CALL instruction (which has now been NOP'ed) is replaced with a breakpoint
instruction. When the breakpoint is taken, all the registers and stack are
set up as if we were going to invoke the dummy function, and are available
as arguments to the probe (arg0, arg1, etc). When dtrace is not running,
there is some overhead to compute those arguments, even though a breakpoint
is not taken. So, it is best to keep the function arguments to be simple,
and not involve complex or time consuming calculations.

<p>
DTrace probes an IS_ENABLED macro to help reduce overhead. For each
probe you create, a macro is defined, allowing code like this:

<pre>
if (SIMPLE_ENTRY_ENABLED()) {
	DTRACE_PROBE1(...);
}
</pre>

where the prefix "SIMPLE" is provided by the header definition for the 
provider.

<h2>What people are using USDT for</h2>
<p>
The dtrace providers in the kernel are varied and powerful. But it
requires device driver and kernel internals knowledge to use or enhance
them. USDT has enormous potential for user land applications. Here are
some common examples, easily found on the web.

<h3>Perl, Ruby, Python, TCL, etc</h3>
<p>
Adding USDT probes to script languages like these, allow for performance
monitoring at the script level, rather than the implementation level.
Getting a stack trace, when a probe is hit in a Perl script, should
result in the Perl stack, not the virtual machine emulator, which is typically
unfathomable.

<h3>HTTP</h3>
<p>
There is probably a wealth of things which could be probed in a running 
http server, e.g. raw requests, form submissions, and other things
which are HTTP server specific.

<p>
I have seen references to HTTP providers, which can be useful
