C code test/example of a USDT. Just make and run - and it should show
up in the 'dtrace -l' list.

Run ../../build/simple-c from the usdt/c directory. (We need
to adjust the LD_LIBRARY_PATH searching, so at the moment, run it
from here).

This will simply display something like:

...
PID:1290 52: here on line 25: crc=000083cf
PID:1290 here on line 27
PID:1290 here on line 29
PID:1290 here on line 31
PID:1290 53: here on line 25: crc=000083cf
PID:1290 here on line 27
PID:1290 here on line 29
PID:1290 here on line 31
...

If a dtrace probe is placed on this process' probe, then you
will see the crc change, indicating a breakpoint got placed.

A test, might be to use gdb to place a breakpoint at the same place
as the usdt and see what happens. (Dtrace will assume it belongs
to it, whilst the process is running).
