 *  The Cyclic Subsystem
 *  --------------------
 *
 *  Prehistory
 *
 *  Historically, most computer architectures have specified interval-based
 *  timer parts (e.g. SPARCstation's counter/timer; Intel's i8254).  While
 *  these parts deal in relative (i.e. not absolute) time values, they are
 *  typically used by the operating system to implement the abstraction of
 *  absolute time.  As a result, these parts cannot typically be reprogrammed
 *  without introducing error in the system's notion of time.
 *
 *  Starting in about 1994, chip architectures began specifying high resolution
 *  timestamp registers.  As of this writing (1999), all major chip families
 *  (UltraSPARC, PentiumPro, MIPS, PowerPC, Alpha) have high resolution
 *  timestamp registers, and two (UltraSPARC and MIPS) have added the capacity
 *  to interrupt based on timestamp values.  These timestamp-compare registers
 *  present a time-based interrupt source which can be reprogrammed arbitrarily
 *  often without introducing error.  Given the low cost of implementing such a
 *  timestamp-compare register (and the tangible benefit of eliminating
 *  discrete timer parts), it is reasonable to expect that future chip
 *  architectures will adopt this feature.
 *
 *  The cyclic subsystem has been designed to take advantage of chip
 *  architectures with the capacity to interrupt based on absolute, high
 *  resolution values of time.
 *
 *  Subsystem Overview
 *
 *  The cyclic subsystem is a low-level kernel subsystem designed to provide
 *  arbitrarily high resolution, per-CPU interval timers (to avoid colliding
 *  with existing terms, we dub such an interval timer a "cyclic").  Cyclics
 *  can be specified to fire at high, lock or low interrupt level, and may be
 *  optionally bound to a CPU or a CPU partition.  A cyclic's CPU or CPU
 *  partition binding may be changed dynamically; the cyclic will be "juggled"
 *  to a CPU which satisfies the new binding.  Alternatively, a cyclic may
 *  be specified to be "omnipresent", denoting firing on all online CPUs.
 *
 *  Cyclic Subsystem Interface Overview
 *  -----------------------------------
 *
 *  The cyclic subsystem has interfaces with the kernel at-large, with other
 *  kernel subsystems (e.g. the processor management subsystem, the checkpoint
 *  resume subsystem) and with the platform (the cyclic backend).  Each
 *  of these interfaces is given a brief synopsis here, and is described
 *  in full above the interface's implementation.
 *
 *  The following diagram displays the cyclic subsystem's interfaces to
 *  other kernel components.  The arrows denote a "calls" relationship, with
 *  the large arrow indicating the cyclic subsystem's consumer interface.
 *  Each arrow is labeled with the section in which the corresponding
 *  interface is described.

 *
 *  Cyclic Subsystem Implementation Overview
 *  ----------------------------------------
 *
 *  The cyclic subsystem is designed to minimize interference between cyclics
 *  on different CPUs.  Thus, all of the cyclic subsystem's data structures
 *  hang off of a per-CPU structure, cyc_cpu.
 *
 *  Each cyc_cpu has a power-of-two sized array of cyclic structures (the
 *  cyp_cyclics member of the cyc_cpu structure).  If cyclic_add() is called
 *  and there does not exist a free slot in the cyp_cyclics array, the size of
 *  the array will be doubled.  The array will never shrink.  Cyclics are
 *  referred to by their index in the cyp_cyclics array, which is of type
 *  cyc_index_t.
 *
 *  The cyclics are kept sorted by expiration time in the cyc_cpu's heap.  The
 *  heap is keyed by cyclic expiration time, with parents expiring earlier
 *  than their children.
 *
 *  Heap Management
 *
 *  The heap is managed primarily by cyclic_fire().  Upon entry, cyclic_fire()
 *  compares the root cyclic's expiration time to the current time.  If the
 *  expiration time is in the past, cyclic_expire() is called on the root
 *  cyclic.  Upon return from cyclic_expire(), the cyclic's new expiration time
 *  is derived by adding its interval to its old expiration time, and a
 *  downheap operation is performed.  After the downheap, cyclic_fire()
 *  examines the (potentially changed) root cyclic, repeating the
 *  cyclic_expire()/add interval/cyclic_downheap() sequence until the root
 *  cyclic has an expiration time in the future.  This expiration time
 *  (guaranteed to be the earliest in the heap) is then communicated to the
 *  backend via cyb_reprogram.  Optimal backends will next call cyclic_fire()
 *  shortly after the root cyclic's expiration time.
 *
 *  To allow efficient, deterministic downheap operations, we implement the
 *  heap as an array (the cyp_heap member of the cyc_cpu structure), with each
 *  element containing an index into the CPU's cyp_cyclics array.
 *
 *  The heap is laid out in the array according to the following:
 *
 *   1.  The root of the heap is always in the 0th element of the heap array
 *   2.  The left and right children of the nth element are element
 *       (((n + 1) << 1) - 1) and element ((n + 1) << 1), respectively.
 *
 *  This layout is standard (see, e.g., Cormen's "Algorithms"); the proof
 *  that these constraints correctly lay out a heap (or indeed, any binary
 *  tree) is trivial and left to the reader.
 *
 *  To see the heap by example, assume our cyclics array has the following
 *  members (at time t):
 *
 *            cy_handler            cy_level      cy_expire
 *            ---------------------------------------------
 *     [ 0]   clock()                   LOCK     t+10000000
 *     [ 1]   deadman()                 HIGH   t+1000000000
 *     [ 2]   clock_highres_fire()       LOW          t+100
 *     [ 3]   clock_highres_fire()       LOW         t+1000
 *     [ 4]   clock_highres_fire()       LOW          t+500
 *     [ 5]   (free)                      --             --
 *     [ 6]   (free)                      --             --
 *     [ 7]   (free)                      --             --
 *
 *  The heap array could be:
 *
 *                [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]
 *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *              |  2  |  3  |  4  |  0  |  1  |  x  |  x  |  x  |
 *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *
 *  Graphically, this array corresponds to the following (excuse the ASCII art):
 *
 *                                       2
 *                                       |
 *                    +------------------+------------------+
 *                    3                                     4
 *                    |
 *          +---------+--------+
 *          0                  1
 *
 *  Note that the heap is laid out by layer:  all nodes at a given depth are
 *  stored in consecutive elements of the array.  Moreover, layers of
 *  consecutive depths are in adjacent element ranges.  This property
 *  guarantees high locality of reference during downheap operations.
 *  Specifically, we are guaranteed that we can downheap to a depth of
 *
 *      lg (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t))
 *
 *  nodes with at most one cache miss.  On UltraSPARC (64 byte e-cache line
 *  size), this corresponds to a depth of four nodes.  Thus, if there are
 *  fewer than sixteen cyclics in the heap, downheaps on UltraSPARC miss at
 *  most once in the e-cache.
 *
 *  Downheaps are required to compare siblings as they proceed down the
 *  heap.  For downheaps proceeding beyond the one-cache-miss depth, every
 *  access to a left child could potentially miss in the cache.  However,
 *  if we assume
 *
 *      (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t)) > 2,
 *
 *  then all siblings are guaranteed to be on the same cache line.  Thus, the
 *  miss on the left child will guarantee a hit on the right child; downheaps
 *  will incur at most one cache miss per layer beyond the one-cache-miss
 *  depth.  The total number of cache misses for heap management during a
 *  downheap operation is thus bounded by
 *
 *      lg (n) - lg (cache_line_size / sizeof (cyc_index_t))
 *
 *  Traditional pointer-based heaps are implemented without regard to
 *  locality.  Downheaps can thus incur two cache misses per layer (one for
 *  each child), but at most one cache miss at the root.  This yields a bound
 *  of
 *
 *      2 * lg (n) - 1
 *
 *  on the total cache misses.
 *
 *  This difference may seem theoretically trivial (the difference is, after
 *  all, constant), but can become substantial in practice -- especially for
 *  caches with very large cache lines and high miss penalties (e.g. TLBs).
 *
 *  Heaps must always be full, balanced trees.  Heap management must therefore
 *  track the next point-of-insertion into the heap.  In pointer-based heaps,
 *  recomputing this point takes O(lg (n)).  Given the layout of the
 *  array-based implementation, however, the next point-of-insertion is
 *  always:
 *
 *      heap[number_of_elements]
 *
 *  We exploit this property by implementing the free-list in the usused
 *  heap elements.  Heap insertion, therefore, consists only of filling in
 *  the cyclic at cyp_cyclics[cyp_heap[number_of_elements]], incrementing
 *  the number of elements, and performing an upheap.  Heap deletion consists
 *  of decrementing the number of elements, swapping the to-be-deleted element
 *  with the element at cyp_heap[number_of_elements], and downheaping.
 *
 *  Filling in more details in our earlier example:
 *
 *                                               +--- free list head
 *                                               |
 *                                               V
 *
 *                [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]
 *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *              |  2  |  3  |  4  |  0  |  1  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
 *              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
 *
 *  To insert into this heap, we would just need to fill in the cyclic at
 *  cyp_cyclics[5], bump the number of elements (from 5 to 6) and perform
 *  an upheap.
 *
 *  If we wanted to remove, say, cyp_cyclics[3], we would first scan for it
 *  in the cyp_heap, and discover it at cyp_heap[1].  We would then decrement
 *  the number of elements (from 5 to 4), swap cyp_heap[1] with cyp_heap[4],
 *  and perform a downheap from cyp_heap[1].  The linear scan is required
 *  because the cyclic does not keep a backpointer into the heap.  This makes
 *  heap manipulation (e.g. downheaps) faster at the expense of removal
 *  operations.
 *
 *  Expiry processing
 *
 *  As alluded to above, cyclic_expire() is called by cyclic_fire() at
 *  CY_HIGH_LEVEL to expire a cyclic.  Cyclic subsystem consumers are
 *  guaranteed that for an arbitrary time t in the future, their cyclic
 *  handler will have been called (t - cyt_when) / cyt_interval times.  Thus,
 *  there must be a one-to-one mapping between a cyclic's expiration at
 *  CY_HIGH_LEVEL and its execution at the desired level (either CY_HIGH_LEVEL,
 *  CY_LOCK_LEVEL or CY_LOW_LEVEL).
 *
 *  For CY_HIGH_LEVEL cyclics, this is trivial; cyclic_expire() simply needs
 *  to call the handler.
 *
 *  For CY_LOCK_LEVEL and CY_LOW_LEVEL cyclics, however, there exists a
 *  potential disconnect:  if the CPU is at an interrupt level less than
 *  CY_HIGH_LEVEL but greater than the level of a cyclic for a period of
 *  time longer than twice the cyclic's interval, the cyclic will be expired
 *  twice before it can be handled.
 *
 *  To maintain the one-to-one mapping, we track the difference between the
 *  number of times a cyclic has been expired and the number of times it's
 *  been handled in a "pending count" (the cy_pend field of the cyclic
 *  structure).  cyclic_expire() thus increments the cy_pend count for the
 *  expired cyclic and posts a soft interrupt at the desired level.  In the
 *  cyclic subsystem's soft interrupt handler, cyclic_softint(), we repeatedly
 *  call the cyclic handler and decrement cy_pend until we have decremented
 *  cy_pend to zero.
 *
 *  The Producer/Consumer Buffer
 *
 *  If we wish to avoid a linear scan of the cyclics array at soft interrupt
 *  level, cyclic_softint() must be able to quickly determine which cyclics
 *  have a non-zero cy_pend count.  We thus introduce a per-soft interrupt
 *  level producer/consumer buffer shared with CY_HIGH_LEVEL.  These buffers
 *  are encapsulated in the cyc_pcbuffer structure, and, like cyp_heap, are
 *  implemented as cyc_index_t arrays (the cypc_buf member of the cyc_pcbuffer
 *  structure).
 *
 *  The producer (cyclic_expire() running at CY_HIGH_LEVEL) enqueues a cyclic
 *  by storing the cyclic's index to cypc_buf[cypc_prodndx] and incrementing
 *  cypc_prodndx.  The consumer (cyclic_softint() running at either
 *  CY_LOCK_LEVEL or CY_LOW_LEVEL) dequeues a cyclic by loading from
 *  cypc_buf[cypc_consndx] and bumping cypc_consndx.  The buffer is empty when
 *  cypc_prodndx == cypc_consndx.
 *
 *  To bound the size of the producer/consumer buffer, cyclic_expire() only
 *  enqueues a cyclic if its cy_pend was zero (if the cyclic's cy_pend is
 *  non-zero, cyclic_expire() only bumps cy_pend).  Symmetrically,
 *  cyclic_softint() only consumes a cyclic after it has decremented the
 *  cy_pend count to zero.
 *
 *  Returning to our example, here is what the CY_LOW_LEVEL producer/consumer
 *  buffer might look like:
 *
 *     cypc_consndx ---+                 +--- cypc_prodndx
 *                     |                 |
 *                     V                 V
 *
 *        [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]

 *                                            [ 7]      -  (free)
 *
 *  In particular, note that clock()'s cy_pend is 1 but that it is _not_ in
 *  this producer/consumer buffer; it would be enqueued in the CY_LOCK_LEVEL
 *  producer/consumer buffer.
 *
 *  Locking
 *
 *  Traditionally, access to per-CPU data structures shared between
 *  interrupt levels is serialized by manipulating programmable interrupt
 *  level:  readers and writers are required to raise their interrupt level
 *  to that of the highest level writer.
 *
 *  For the producer/consumer buffers (shared between cyclic_fire()/
 *  cyclic_expire() executing at CY_HIGH_LEVEL and cyclic_softint() executing
 *  at one of CY_LOCK_LEVEL or CY_LOW_LEVEL), forcing cyclic_softint() to raise
 *  programmable interrupt level is undesirable:  aside from the additional
 *  latency incurred by manipulating interrupt level in the hot cy_pend
 *  processing path, this would create the potential for soft level cy_pend
 *  processing to delay CY_HIGH_LEVEL firing and expiry processing.
 *  CY_LOCK/LOW_LEVEL cyclics could thereby induce jitter in CY_HIGH_LEVEL
 *  cyclics.
 *
 *  To minimize jitter, then, we would like the cyclic_fire()/cyclic_expire()
 *  and cyclic_softint() code paths to be lock-free.
 *
 *  For cyclic_fire()/cyclic_expire(), lock-free execution is straightforward:
 *  because these routines execute at a higher interrupt level than
 *  cyclic_softint(), their actions on the producer/consumer buffer appear
 *  atomic.  In particular, the increment of cy_pend appears to occur
 *  atomically with the increment of cypc_prodndx.
 *
 *  For cyclic_softint(), however, lock-free execution requires more delicacy.
 *  When cyclic_softint() discovers a cyclic in the producer/consumer buffer,
 *  it calls the cyclic's handler and attempts to atomically decrement the
 *  cy_pend count with a compare&swap operation.
 *
 *  If the compare&swap operation succeeds, cyclic_softint() behaves
 *  conditionally based on the value it atomically wrote to cy_pend:
 *
 *     - If the cy_pend was decremented to 0, the cyclic has been consumed;
 *       cyclic_softint() increments the cypc_consndx and checks for more
 *       enqueued work.
 *
 *     - If the count was decremented to a non-zero value, there is more work
 *       to be done on the cyclic; cyclic_softint() calls the cyclic handler
 *       and repeats the atomic decrement process.
 *
 *  If the compare&swap operation fails, cyclic_softint() knows that
 *  cyclic_expire() has intervened and bumped the cy_pend count (resizes
 *  and removals complicate this, however -- see the sections on their
 *  operation, below).  cyclic_softint() thus reloads cy_pend, and re-attempts
 *  the atomic decrement.
 *
 *  Recall that we bound the size of the producer/consumer buffer by
 *  having cyclic_expire() only enqueue the specified cyclic if its
 *  cy_pend count is zero; this assures that each cyclic is enqueued at
 *  most once.  This leads to a critical constraint on cyclic_softint(),
 *  however:  after the compare&swap operation which successfully decrements
 *  cy_pend to zero, cyclic_softint() must _not_ re-examine the consumed
 *  cyclic.  In part to obey this constraint, cyclic_softint() calls the
 *  cyclic handler before decrementing cy_pend.
 *
 *  Resizing
 *
 *  All of the discussion thus far has assumed a static number of cyclics.
 *  Obviously, static limitations are not practical; we need the capacity
 *  to resize our data structures dynamically.
 *
 *  We resize our data structures lazily, and only on a per-CPU basis.
 *  The size of the data structures always doubles and never shrinks.  We
 *  serialize adds (and thus resizes) on cpu_lock; we never need to deal
 *  with concurrent resizes.  Resizes should be rare; they may induce jitter
 *  on the CPU being resized, but should not affect cyclic operation on other
 *  CPUs.  Pending cyclics may not be dropped during a resize operation.
 *
 *  Three key cyc_cpu data structures need to be resized:  the cyclics array,
 *  the heap array and the producer/consumer buffers.  Resizing the first two
 *  is relatively straightforward:
 *
 *    1.  The new, larger arrays are allocated in cyclic_expand() (called
 *        from cyclic_add()).
 *    2.  cyclic_expand() cross calls cyclic_expand_xcall() on the CPU
 *        undergoing the resize.
 *    3.  cyclic_expand_xcall() raises interrupt level to CY_HIGH_LEVEL
 *    4.  The contents of the old arrays are copied into the new arrays.
 *    5.  The old cyclics array is bzero()'d
 *    6.  The pointers are updated.
 *
 *  The producer/consumer buffer is dicier:  cyclic_expand_xcall() may have
 *  interrupted cyclic_softint() in the middle of consumption. To resize the
 *  producer/consumer buffer, we implement up to two buffers per soft interrupt
 *  level:  a hard buffer (the buffer being produced into by cyclic_expire())
 *  and a soft buffer (the buffer from which cyclic_softint() is consuming).
 *  During normal operation, the hard buffer and soft buffer point to the
 *  same underlying producer/consumer buffer.
 *
 *  During a resize, however, cyclic_expand_xcall() changes the hard buffer
 *  to point to the new, larger producer/consumer buffer; all future
 *  cyclic_expire()'s will produce into the new buffer.  cyclic_expand_xcall()
 *  then posts a CY_LOCK_LEVEL soft interrupt, landing in cyclic_softint().
 *
 *  As under normal operation, cyclic_softint() will consume cyclics from
 *  its soft buffer.  After the soft buffer is drained, however,
 *  cyclic_softint() will see that the hard buffer has changed.  At that time,
 *  cyclic_softint() will change its soft buffer to point to the hard buffer,
 *  and repeat the producer/consumer buffer draining procedure.
 *
 *  After the new buffer is drained, cyclic_softint() will determine if both
 *  soft levels have seen their new producer/consumer buffer.  If both have,
 *  cyclic_softint() will post on the semaphore cyp_modify_wait.  If not, a
 *  soft interrupt will be generated for the remaining level.
 *
 *  cyclic_expand() blocks on the cyp_modify_wait semaphore (a semaphore is
 *  used instead of a condition variable because of the race between the
 *  sema_p() in cyclic_expand() and the sema_v() in cyclic_softint()).  This
 *  allows cyclic_expand() to know when the resize operation is complete;
 *  all of the old buffers (the heap, the cyclics array and the producer/
 *  consumer buffers) can be freed.
 *
 *  A final caveat on resizing:  we described step (5) in the
 *  cyclic_expand_xcall() procedure without providing any motivation.  This
 *  step addresses the problem of a cyclic_softint() attempting to decrement
 *  a cy_pend count while interrupted by a cyclic_expand_xcall().  Because
 *  cyclic_softint() has already called the handler by the time cy_pend is
 *  decremented, we want to assure that it doesn't decrement a cy_pend
 *  count in the old cyclics array.  By zeroing the old cyclics array in
 *  cyclic_expand_xcall(), we are zeroing out every cy_pend count; when
 *  cyclic_softint() attempts to compare&swap on the cy_pend count, it will
 *  fail and recognize that the count has been zeroed.  cyclic_softint() will
 *  update its stale copy of the cyp_cyclics pointer, re-read the cy_pend
 *  count from the new cyclics array, and re-attempt the compare&swap.
 *
 *  Removals
 *
 *  Cyclic removals should be rare.  To simplify the implementation (and to
 *  allow optimization for the cyclic_fire()/cyclic_expire()/cyclic_softint()
 *  path), we force removals and adds to serialize on cpu_lock.
 *
 *  Cyclic removal is complicated by a guarantee made to the consumer of
 *  the cyclic subsystem:  after cyclic_remove() returns, the cyclic handler
 *  has returned and will never again be called.
 *
 *  Here is the procedure for cyclic removal:
 *
 *    1.  cyclic_remove() calls cyclic_remove_xcall() on the CPU undergoing
 *        the removal.
 *    2.  cyclic_remove_xcall() raises interrupt level to CY_HIGH_LEVEL
 *    3.  The current expiration time for the removed cyclic is recorded.
 *    4.  If the cy_pend count on the removed cyclic is non-zero, it
 *        is copied into cyp_rpend and subsequently zeroed.
 *    5.  The cyclic is removed from the heap
 *    6.  If the root of the heap has changed, the backend is reprogrammed.
 *    7.  If the cy_pend count was non-zero cyclic_remove() blocks on the
 *        cyp_modify_wait semaphore.
 *
 *  The motivation for step (3) is explained in "Juggling", below.
 *
 *  The cy_pend count is decremented in cyclic_softint() after the cyclic
 *  handler returns.  Thus, if we find a cy_pend count of zero in step
 *  (4), we know that cyclic_remove() doesn't need to block.
 *
 *  If the cy_pend count is non-zero, however, we must block in cyclic_remove()
 *  until cyclic_softint() has finished calling the cyclic handler.  To let
 *  cyclic_softint() know that this cyclic has been removed, we zero the
 *  cy_pend count.  This will cause cyclic_softint()'s compare&swap to fail.
 *  When cyclic_softint() sees the zero cy_pend count, it knows that it's been
 *  caught during a resize (see "Resizing", above) or that the cyclic has been
 *  removed.  In the latter case, it calls cyclic_remove_pend() to call the
 *  cyclic handler cyp_rpend - 1 times, and posts on cyp_modify_wait.
 *
 *  Juggling
 *
 *  At first glance, cyclic juggling seems to be a difficult problem.  The
 *  subsystem must guarantee that a cyclic doesn't execute simultaneously on
 *  different CPUs, while also assuring that a cyclic fires exactly once
 *  per interval.  We solve this problem by leveraging a property of the
 *  platform:  gethrtime() is required to increase in lock-step across
 *  multiple CPUs.  Therefore, to juggle a cyclic, we remove it from its
 *  CPU, recording its expiration time in the remove cross call (step (3)
 *  in "Removing", above).  We then add the cyclic to the new CPU, explicitly
 *  setting its expiration time to the time recorded in the removal.  This
 *  leverages the existing cyclic expiry processing, which will compensate
 *  for any time lost while juggling.

 *
 *  Arguments and notes
 *
 *    The first argument to cyclic_softint() is the CPU on which the interrupt
 *    is executing; backends must call into cyclic_softint() on the specified
 *    CPU.  The second argument is the level of the soft interrupt; it must
 *    be one of CY_LOCK_LEVEL or CY_LOW_LEVEL.
 *
 *    cyclic_softint() will call the handlers for cyclics pending at the
 *    specified level.  cyclic_softint() will not return until all pending
 *    cyclics at the specified level have been dealt with; intervening
 *    CY_HIGH_LEVEL interrupts which enqueue cyclics at the specified level
 *    may therefore prolong cyclic_softint().
 *
 *    cyclic_softint() never disables interrupts, and, if neither a
 *    cyclic_add() nor a cyclic_remove() is pending on the specified CPU, is
 *    lock-free.  This assures that in the common case, cyclic_softint()
 *    completes without blocking, and never starves cyclic_fire().  If either
 *    cyclic_add() or cyclic_remove() is pending, cyclic_softint() may grab
 *    a dispatcher lock.
 *
 *    While cyclic_softint() is designed for bounded latency, it is obviously
 *    at the mercy of its cyclic handlers.  Because cyclic handlers may block
 *    arbitrarily, callers of cyclic_softint() should not rely upon
 *    deterministic completion.
 *
 *    cyclic_softint() may be called spuriously without ill effect.
 *
 *  Return value
 *
 *    None.
 *
 *  Caller's context
 *
 *    The caller must be executing in soft interrupt context at either
 *    CY_LOCK_LEVEL or CY_LOW_LEVEL.  The level passed to cyclic_softint()
 *    must match the level at which it is executing.  On optimal backends,
 *    the caller will hold no locks.  In any case, the caller may not hold

/*
 *  cyclic_id_t cyclic_add(cyc_handler_t *, cyc_time_t *)
 *
 *  Overview
 *
 *    cyclic_add() will create an unbound cyclic with the specified handler and
 *    interval.  The cyclic will run on a CPU which both has interrupts enabled
 *    and is in the system CPU partition.
 *
 *  Arguments and notes
 *
 *    As its first argument, cyclic_add() takes a cyc_handler, which has the
 *    following members:
 *
 *      cyc_func_t cyh_func    <-- Cyclic handler
 *      void *cyh_arg          <-- Argument to cyclic handler
 *      cyc_level_t cyh_level  <-- Level at which to fire; must be one of
 *                                 CY_LOW_LEVEL, CY_LOCK_LEVEL or CY_HIGH_LEVEL
 *
 *    Note that cyh_level is _not_ an ipl or spl; it must be one the
 *    CY_*_LEVELs.  This layer of abstraction allows the platform to define
 *    the precise interrupt priority levels, within the following constraints:
 *
 *       CY_LOCK_LEVEL must map to LOCK_LEVEL
 *       CY_HIGH_LEVEL must map to an ipl greater than LOCK_LEVEL
 *       CY_LOW_LEVEL must map to an ipl below LOCK_LEVEL
 *
 *    In addition to a cyc_handler, cyclic_add() takes a cyc_time, which
 *    has the following members:
 *
 *       hrtime_t cyt_when     <-- Absolute time, in nanoseconds since boot, at
 *                                 which to start firing
 *       hrtime_t cyt_interval <-- Length of interval, in nanoseconds
 *
 *    gethrtime() is the time source for nanoseconds since boot.  If cyt_when
 *    is set to 0, the cyclic will start to fire when cyt_interval next
 *    divides the number of nanoseconds since boot.
 *
 *    The cyt_interval field _must_ be filled in by the caller; one-shots are
 *    _not_ explicitly supported by the cyclic subsystem (cyclic_add() will
 *    assert that cyt_interval is non-zero).  The maximum value for either
 *    field is INT64_MAX; the caller is responsible for assuring that
 *    cyt_when + cyt_interval <= INT64_MAX.  Neither field may be negative.
 *
 *    For an arbitrary time t in the future, the cyclic handler is guaranteed
 *    to have been called (t - cyt_when) / cyt_interval times.  This will
 *    be true even if interrupts have been disabled for periods greater than
 *    cyt_interval nanoseconds.  In order to compensate for such periods,
 *    the cyclic handler may be called a finite number of times with an
 *    arbitrarily small interval.
 *
 *    The cyclic subsystem will not enforce any lower bound on the interval;
 *    if the interval is less than the time required to process an interrupt,
 *    the CPU will wedge.  It's the responsibility of the caller to assure that
 *    either the value of the interval is sane, or that its caller has
 *    sufficient privilege to deny service (i.e. its caller is root).
 *
 *    The cyclic handler is guaranteed to be single threaded, even while the
 *    cyclic is being juggled between CPUs (see cyclic_juggle(), below).
 *    That is, a given cyclic handler will never be executed simultaneously
 *    on different CPUs.
 *

 *    not been configured with respect to the cyclic subsystem, but only
 *    configured CPUs will be eligible to run the new cyclic.
 *
 *  Cyclic handler's context
 *
 *    Cyclic handlers will be executed in the interrupt context corresponding
 *    to the specified level (i.e. either high, lock or low level).  The
 *    usual context rules apply.
 *
 *    A cyclic handler may not grab ANY locks held by the caller of any of
 *    cyclic_add(), cyclic_remove() or cyclic_bind(); the implementation of
 *    these functions may require blocking on cyclic handler completion.
 *    Moreover, cyclic handlers may not make any call back into the cyclic

/*
 *  cyclic_id_t cyclic_add_omni(cyc_omni_handler_t *)
 *
 *  Overview
 *
 *    cyclic_add_omni() will create an omnipresent cyclic with the specified
 *    online and offline handlers.  Omnipresent cyclics run on all online
 *    CPUs, including CPUs which have unbound interrupts disabled.
 *
 *  Arguments
 *
 *    As its only argument, cyclic_add_omni() takes a cyc_omni_handler, which
 *    has the following members:
 *
 *      void (*cyo_online)()   <-- Online handler
 *      void (*cyo_offline)()  <-- Offline handler
 *      void *cyo_arg          <-- Argument to be passed to on/offline handlers
 *
 *  Online handler
 *
 *    The cyo_online member is a pointer to a function which has the following
 *    four arguments:
 *
 *      void *                 <-- Argument (cyo_arg)
 *      cpu_t *                <-- Pointer to CPU about to be onlined
 *      cyc_handler_t *        <-- Pointer to cyc_handler_t; must be filled in
 *                                 by omni online handler
 *      cyc_time_t *           <-- Pointer to cyc_time_t; must be filled in by
 *                                 omni online handler
 *
 *    The omni cyclic online handler is always called _before_ the omni
 *    cyclic begins to fire on the specified CPU.  As the above argument
 *    description implies, the online handler must fill in the two structures
 *    passed to it:  the cyc_handler_t and the cyc_time_t.  These are the
 *    same two structures passed to cyclic_add(), outlined above.  This
 *    allows the omni cyclic to have maximum flexibility; different CPUs may
 *    optionally
 *
 *      (a)  have different intervals
 *      (b)  be explicitly in or out of phase with one another
 *      (c)  have different handlers
 *      (d)  have different handler arguments
 *      (e)  fire at different levels
 *
 *    Of these, (e) seems somewhat dubious, but is nonetheless allowed.
 *
 *    The omni online handler is called in the same context as cyclic_add(),
 *    and has the same liberties:  omni online handlers may perform KM_SLEEP
 *    kernel memory allocations, and may grab locks which are also acquired
 *    by cyclic handlers.  However, omni cyclic online handlers may _not_
 *    call back into the cyclic subsystem, and should be generally careful
 *    about calling into arbitrary kernel subsystems.
 *
 *  Offline handler
 *
 *    The cyo_offline member is a pointer to a function which has the following
 *    three arguments:
 *
 *      void *                 <-- Argument (cyo_arg)
 *      cpu_t *                <-- Pointer to CPU about to be offlined
 *      void *                 <-- CPU's cyclic argument (that is, value
 *                                 to which cyh_arg member of the cyc_handler_t
 *                                 was set in the omni online handler)
 *
 *    The omni cyclic offline handler is always called _after_ the omni
 *    cyclic has ceased firing on the specified CPU.  Its purpose is to
 *    allow cleanup of any resources dynamically allocated in the omni cyclic
 *    online handler.  The context of the offline handler is identical to
 *    that of the online handler; the same constraints and liberties apply.
 *
 *    The offline handler is optional; it may be NULL.
 *
 *  Return value
 *
 *    cyclic_add_omni() returns a cyclic_id_t, which is guaranteed to be a
 *    value other than CYCLIC_NONE.  cyclic_add_omni() cannot fail.
 *
 *  Caller's context
 *
 *    The caller's context is identical to that of cyclic_add(), specified
 *    above.

 *

 *  void cyclic_bind(cyclic_id_t, cpu_t *, cpupart_t *)
 *
 *  Overview
 *
 *    cyclic_bind() atomically changes the CPU and CPU partition bindings
 *    of a cyclic.
 *
 *  Arguments and notes
 *
 *    The first argument is a cyclic_id retuned from cyclic_add().
 *    cyclic_bind() may _not_ be called on a cyclic_id returned from
 *    cyclic_add_omni().
 *
 *    The second argument specifies the CPU to which to bind the specified
 *    cyclic.  If the specified cyclic is bound to a CPU other than the one
 *    specified, it will be unbound from its bound CPU.  Unbinding the cyclic
 *    from its CPU may cause it to be juggled to another CPU.  If the specified
 *    CPU is non-NULL, the cyclic will be subsequently rebound to the specified
 *    CPU.
 *
 *    If a CPU with bound cyclics is transitioned into the P_NOINTR state,
 *    only cyclics not bound to the CPU can be juggled away; CPU-bound cyclics
 *    will continue to fire on the P_NOINTR CPU.  A CPU with bound cyclics
 *    cannot be offlined (attempts to offline the CPU will return EBUSY).
 *    Likewise, cyclics may not be bound to an offline CPU; if the caller
 *    attempts to bind a cyclic to an offline CPU, the cyclic subsystem will
 *    panic.
 *
 *    The third argument specifies the CPU partition to which to bind the
 *    specified cyclic.  If the specified cyclic is bound to a CPU partition
 *    other than the one specified, it will be unbound from its bound
 *    partition.  Unbinding the cyclic from its CPU partition may cause it
 *    to be juggled to another CPU.  If the specified CPU partition is
 *    non-NULL, the cyclic will be subsequently rebound to the specified CPU
 *    partition.
 *
 *    It is the caller's responsibility to assure that the specified CPU
 *    partition contains a CPU.  If it does not, the cyclic subsystem will
 *    panic.  A CPU partition with bound cyclics cannot be destroyed (attempts
 *    to destroy the partition will return EBUSY).  If a CPU with
 *    partition-bound cyclics is transitioned into the P_NOINTR state, cyclics
 *    bound to the CPU's partition (but not bound to the CPU) will be juggled
 *    away only if there exists another CPU in the partition in the P_ONLINE
 *    state.
 *
 *    It is the caller's responsibility to assure that the specified CPU and
 *    CPU partition are self-consistent.  If both parameters are non-NULL,
 *    and the specified CPU partition does not contain the specified CPU, the
 *    cyclic subsystem will panic.
 *
 *    It is the caller's responsibility to assure that the specified CPU has
 *    been configured with respect to the cyclic subsystem.  Generally, this
 *    is always true for valid, on-line CPUs.  The only periods of time during
 *    which this may not be true are during MP boot (i.e. after cyclic_init()
 *    is called but before cyclic_mp_init() is called) or during dynamic
 *    reconfiguration; cyclic_bind() should only be called with great care
 *    from these contexts.
 *
 *  Return value
 *
 *    None; cyclic_bind() always succeeds.
 *
 *  Caller's context
 *
 *    cpu_lock must be held by the caller, and the caller must not be in
 *    interrupt context.  The caller may not hold any locks which are also

/*
 *  void cyclic_suspend()
 *
 *  Overview
 *
 *    cyclic_suspend() suspends all cyclic activity throughout the cyclic
 *    subsystem.  It should be called only by subsystems which are attempting
 *    to suspend the entire system (e.g. checkpoint/resume, dynamic
 *    reconfiguration).
 *
 *  Arguments and notes
 *
 *    cyclic_suspend() takes no arguments.  Each CPU with an active cyclic
 *    disables its backend (offline CPUs disable their backends as part of
 *    the cyclic_offline() operation), thereby disabling future CY_HIGH_LEVEL
 *    interrupts.
 *
 *    Note that disabling CY_HIGH_LEVEL interrupts does not completely preclude
 *    cyclic handlers from being called after cyclic_suspend() returns:  if a
 *    CY_LOCK_LEVEL or CY_LOW_LEVEL interrupt thread was blocked at the time
 *    of cyclic_suspend(), cyclic handlers at its level may continue to be
 *    called after the interrupt thread becomes unblocked.  The
 *    post-cyclic_suspend() activity is bounded by the pend count on all
 *    cyclics at the time of cyclic_suspend().  Callers concerned with more
 *    than simply disabling future CY_HIGH_LEVEL interrupts must check for
 *    this condition.
 *
 *    On most platforms, timestamps from gethrtime() and gethrestime() are not
 *    guaranteed to monotonically increase between cyclic_suspend() and
 *    cyclic_resume().  However, timestamps are guaranteed to monotonically
 *    increase across the entire cyclic_suspend()/cyclic_resume() operation.
 *    That is, every timestamp obtained before cyclic_suspend() will be less
 *    than every timestamp obtained after cyclic_resume().
 *
 *  Return value
 *
 *    None; cyclic_suspend() always succeeds.
 *
 *  Caller's context
 *
 *    The cyclic subsystem must be configured on every valid CPU;
 *    cyclic_suspend() may not be called during boot or during dynamic
 *    reconfiguration.  Additionally, cpu_lock must be held, and the caller
 *    cannot be in high-level interrupt context.  However, unlike most other
 *    cyclic entry points, cyclic_suspend() may be called with locks held
 *    which are also acquired by CY_LOCK_LEVEL or CY_LOW_LEVEL cyclic
 *    handlers.
